A piece of the handle has been chipped off and the number 3 has been etched to the botton of the hanld. but it doesn't matter so you put it into your inventory as you might find a use for it later";

You walk over and crouch down and then you notice a phone wedged in the dirt behind one of the cornstalks.

    static String OuterBanks_Desc = "The exit from the hallway leads to an area outside of the prison that originally looked like a farm. Now the cornstalks have grown so tall that it becomes impossible for you to see over. However, there seems to be pathways leading to the south, north, and east.";
